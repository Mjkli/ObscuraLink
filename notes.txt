Notes for reference when i need to look at a different part. 

# - Architecture
Main controller
 - Node to hold all nodes info.
 - When requested for node id it should return public IP and public key of said node
 - When a new node starts it should get their public IP and send it to the main controller

Nodes
   - ^
   - Nodes should be ablet to receive a packet encrypt the packet and send it to the next node in the chain.
        - When it gets a response it should be able to encrypt said packet and send it back to the node before.
        - once the messages gets back to the original sender they should be able to decrypt the message with all the keys. 

        computer -->(request)Encrypted with all keys in sequence --> (Entry Node) decrypt its layer --> (Node) decrypt its layer --> (exit Node) decrypt its layer: packet is unencrypted here --> webpage.

todo:

 - capture packets from network
 - send packets to network

 - test on pis
    test should be for the node in the middle to take a packet from one interface and forward it to the reciver
    Sender pi -> Node -> reciver pi

 - Setup Key sharing between nodes
 - Setup encryption / decryption of packets.
 - Pis should be able to send keys to eachother then the sender should be able to encrypt its packet then the reciver should be able to decrypt the packet.
